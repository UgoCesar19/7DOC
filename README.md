# 7 Days Of Code - Spring Framework (Alura)
7 Days Of Code - Spring Framework Challenge

This is the first step of the challenge.

For this I'm consuming the IMDB top 250 movies API, and retrieving the response body, corresponding of a raw JSON with movies details.

You could import this repository and run the application in your favorite IDE or just run the JAR file.

Then you can test the result using your browser or other tool, passing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/api/movies/top?apiKey=YOUR_IMDB_API_KEY

To create a free API key, as I've done, access the following [URL](https://imdb-api.com/Identity/Account/Register), and follow the steps.

After you are registered, you could get your API_KEY in your profile page.
